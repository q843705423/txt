I think it will be very useful quick-key,
about
Alt+1,if your don't want to use mouse,it is very nessery.
you can use the commond to shift your view in code view and project view.
please trust me, it can help your chance file so quickly.
but if your want to quick find file, a new quick-key is more useful.
it is Ctrl+Shift+N
but if your use idea+vim,it is unuseful.
so let me talk your other key-map
because I like vim,so I don't want to loss vim feature.
some useful vim commond if inflict with vim quick-key.
like 0 ^ $ 
it can move to line begin or end,it is very useful in this 
like gg G 
it  can move in file begin or end
like v 
we can go to model of visable view.
like yy p

like w e b 
we can go to pre or next word.
like f  t 
we can go to somewhere we want 
like a i o O

like d c x
we can delete or replace word or case
like u
